This app was built to complement a Tech Talk I gave in Tokyo, Japan about VR in the Medical World.
It's a demonstration of how VR Exposure Therapy can be applied to overcome common phobias like the fear of heights, driving, and public speaking.
It was built using React360 and 360 videos I captured using a Ricoh Theta S camera.
A user can use a raycaster to navigate through virtual environments created by 360 videos riding a giant Ferris Wheel with all glass walls, driving through Shibuya, and speaking in front of a small audience.
